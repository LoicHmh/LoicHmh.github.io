In clinical practice, the source data usually cannot be accessed during adaptation for privacy policy and the label for the target domain is in shortage because of the high cost of professional labeling. Therefore, it is worth considering how to eﬀiciently adopt a pretrained model with only unlabeled data from the target domain. In this paper, we propose a novel fully test-time unsupervised adaptation method for image segmentation based on Regional Nuclear-norm (RN) and Contour Regularization (CR). The RN loss is specially designed for segmentation tasks to eﬀiciently improve discriminability and diversity of prediction. The CR loss constrains the continuity and connectivity to enhance the relevance between pixels and their neighbors. Instead of retraining all pa- rameters, we modify only the parameters in batch normalization layers with only a few epochs. We demonstrate the effectiveness and eﬀiciency of the proposed method in the pancreas and liver segmentation dataset from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon and CHAOS challenge.")])])])]),e._v(" "),n("ProjectCard",{attrs:{hideBorder:"true"}},[n("h3",{attrs:{id:"knowledge-distillation-from-multi-modal-to-mono-modal-segmentation-networks"}},[e._v("Knowledge distillation from multi-modal to mono-modal segmentation networks")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("International Conference on Medical Image Computing & Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2020) ["),n("a",{attrs:{href:"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-59710-8_75",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Link"),n("OutboundLink")],1),e._v("] ["),n("a",{attrs:{href:"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09564.pdf",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("PDF"),n("OutboundLink")],1),e._v("]")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[n("strong",[e._v("M Hu")]),e._v(", M Maillard, Y Zhang, T Ciceri, G La Barbera, I Bloch, P Gori")]),e._v(" "),n("details",[n("summary",[e._v("Abstract")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[n("em",[e._v("The joint use of multiple imaging modalities for medical image segmentation has been widely studied in recent years. The fusion of information from different modalities has demonstrated to improve the segmentation accuracy, with respect to mono-modal segmentations, in several applications. However, acquiring multiple modalities is usually not possible in a clinical setting due to a limited number of physicians and scanners, and to limit costs and scan time. Most of the time, only one modality is acquired. In this paper, we propose KD-Net, a framework to transfer knowledge from a trained multi-modal network (teacher) to a mono-modal one (student). The proposed method is an adaptation of the generalized distillation framework where the student network is trained on a subset (1 modality) of the teacher’s inputs (n modalities). We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in brain tumor segmentation with the BraTS 2018 dataset. Using different architectures, we show that the student network effectively learns from the teacher and always outperforms the baseline mono-modal network in terms of segmentation accuracy.")])])])]),e._v(" "),n("h2",{attrs:{id:"awards-honors"}},[e._v("Awards & Honors")]),e._v(" "),n("h3",{attrs:{id:"contests"}},[e._v("Contests")]),e._v(" "),n("ul",[n("li",[e._v("[June 2020] "),n("a",{attrs:{href:"https://www.biendata.xyz/competition/kddcup_2020/winners/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("First place"),n("OutboundLink")],1),e._v(" in "),n("strong",[e._v("KDD Cup 2020")]),e._v(" "),n("a",{attrs:{href:"https://biendata.com/competition/kddcup_2020/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Regular Machine Learning Competition Track (ML Track 2)"),n("OutboundLink")],1)]),e._v(" "),n("li",[e._v("[Aug. 2017] Grand Prize in BRICS Makers Competition of 2017 BRICS Skills Development & Technology Innovation Competition.")])]),e._v(" "),n("p",[n("img",{attrs:{src:"https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=https://loichmh.github.io",alt:"visitors"}})])],1)}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=r.exports},92:function(e,t,n){}}]);
